abstract = "In this paper we suggest the first systematic review and compare performance of most frequently used machine learning algorithms for prediction of the match winner from the teamsâ€™ drafts in Dota 2 computer game. Although previous research attempted this task with simple models, weve made several improvements in our approach aiming to take into account interactions among heroes in the draft. For that purpose weâ€™ve tested the following machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes classifier, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. We also introduced Factorization Machines for that task and got our best results from them. Besides that, we found that modelâ€™s prediction accuracy depends on skill level of the players. Weâ€™ve prepared publicly available dataset which takes into account shortcomings of data used in previous research and can be used further for algorithms development, testing and benchmarking."
